# Project Traceroute: Mapping the Pulse of Indian Deliveries

This project simulates India's delivery ecosystem using **AI-generated synthetic data** to understand
geospatial delivery behavior, clustering, and operational dynamics.

###  Features
- Synthetic data generation with realistic latitude/longitude distributions  
- Geospatial visualization using Plotly and Haversine distances  
- Clustering with KMeans, DBSCAN, and HDBSCAN  
- Supervised learning models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)  
- SHAP explainability for model transparency  
- Executive-level analytical report (PDF included)

###  Results Summary
| Task | Best Model | Accuracy | Macro F1 |
|------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Delivery Status Prediction | XGBoost | 0.91 | 0.46 |
| Cluster Membership Prediction | LightGBM | 0.96 | 0.95 |
